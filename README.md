# Strategies for Bank Marketing Using Machine Learning
The dataset is obtained from : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing

## About the project
The State bank wants to improve it's marketing strategies to reach more members. The State bank has given it's past marketing data to the data team to resolve this problem. So, the data team will use a Machine Learning model to predict if the customer has subscribed to the term deposit based on the data and analyse the past data to get the important features that we should empahsize more on to reach more customers in future campaigns.

In this project we will use the bank marketing dataset which is availabe in UCI Machine Learning repository and the dataset consists of 
1. Bank Cilent Data
2. The contact information of the campaign
3. Other attributes

Here, our dependent variable will be y- has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes','no')

## Insights from the project
We have used a classification algorithm called Random Forest Classifier to predict our y varibale. 
We have acheived an accuracy of 73% using hyperparameter tuning.
